                    I grew up in a very hard-working immigrant family, where we prioritize learning and gaining wisdom. In the early 90's, when I was just a child, my family started a small business in the personal protective equipment industry. Growing up in the business, I learned a lot about finance, marketing, and design. In high school, I discovered a love for creative writing and pursued it all the way to a Masters degree from the University of Notre Dame. After graduating, I went back to my roots in finance and earned my CFA charter in 2019. Since then, I've been working in the investment field. But, technology has always been a hobby and passion of mine.
