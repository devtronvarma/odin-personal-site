# odin-personal-site

This is my first attempt at making a website just from a picture and a set of loose guidelines for formatting and color pallette. I took some paths for formatting the content that may not be the most efficient, but the layout of the site looks pretty close to the picture provided by The Odin Project.

This is just a single step on my learning path, and I recognize that path can loop back on itself. Hopefully, I'll have the opportunity to make this page look even better (and make its underlying code all the more efficient and readable)!

To progress!
